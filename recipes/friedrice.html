             <p>You would be hard-pressed to find a Chinese household that doesn’t enjoy a good bowl of fried rice. Growing up, whenever I saw a large bowl of cooked rice in the kitchen, I would cross my fingers and wait with eager anticipation to see if it was fried rice night. The flavor of rice mixed with eggs, vegetables, and a thin layer of soy sauce was something that brought comfort to my belly.</p>
             <br/>
                <p>It probably comes as no surprise that I cook fried rice very frequently. Not only do I find this dish comforting, but it is also darn easy to make. All you really need is rice, eggs, vegetables, and soy sauce. Once you get into the rhythm of this basic egg fried rice recipe, play around with it! Substitute rice for quinoa, add other vegetables or protein—do whatever suits your taste.</p>

                <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups diced mixed vegetables, such as bell pepper, carrots, zucchini, etc. (see note 3)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sliced scallions, white and green parts divided (see note 4)</li>
                <li>pinch of salt</li>
                <li> 4 cups cooked overnight jasmine rice, see note 5</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, use tamari if gluten free</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
                <li>dash of ground white pepper, optional</li>
                <li>to 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
                </ul>
        <div class="steps"></div>
            <ol id="steps">
                <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them together.
                </li>
                <li>Heat a skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the beaten eggs and scramble them for about a minute. Transfer the eggs to a dish and turn off the heat.
                </li>
                <li>Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into a wok over high heat. Add the onions and cook them for about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mixed vegetables and white parts of the scallions and cook for 2 minutes. Season the vegetables with a pinch of salt.
                </li>
                <li>Add the cooked rice into the pan or wok and cook for several minutes, until the rice is heated through. If there are large clumps of rice, break them apart with the back of your spatula.
                </li>
                <li>Add the soy sauce, five-spice powder, dash of white pepper (if using) and sesame oil and stir to distribute the seasonings. (See note 6) Add the scrambled eggs and stir to mix again. Garnish with remaining sliced scallions. Serve immediately.
